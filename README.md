# Integration between Axis devices and Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Getting started with the repo

This repository shows a couple of examples where Axis devices are configured to use services within Amazon Web Service (AWS). It's related to [AxisCommunications/acap3-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples/), but instead of focusing on building AXIS Camera applications it focuses on creating the integration between the Axis device and AWS.

The repository contains a set of examples, each tailored towards a specific problem. All examples have a README file in its directory which shows overview, example directory structure and step-by-step instructions on how on how to deploy the AWS infrastructure and how to configure the camera to interact with AWS.
